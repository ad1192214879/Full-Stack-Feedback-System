Technologies : React js, Node js, flask, Postman, MongoDb,MongoDb Compass, Ant Design

Process:We download and install the useful softwares and components, like node.js, create-react-app, flask library, Postman, MongoDb, MongoDb Compass, antd library. First, we configure the environment of react and establish a react project. Then, we take the antd component to contribute to the project by VS Code, letting the page to become a submitting form which contains input, texarea, select, button. After that, we use flask library to establish a interface between front end and back end so that our back end can receive form data from front end. Then we produce a mongo database, achieving how to c data of the mongo database. We can turn our data into a json file after we put the form data into mongo database. At last, we can create a presentation page for the users to see more directly with our data from the file.

Feelings: After the project, I experience the whole process of how data come from the web, then to back end and database, and to the front end at last which is the full process of a product.
